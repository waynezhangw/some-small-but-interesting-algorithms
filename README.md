For sharing the algorithm that I met during my academic and industrial career

# 1.Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for undirected graph  
	Input:  
  	  head id - tail id - edge cost  
  	  1 - 3 - 13  
  	  1 - 9 - 25  
  	  ...  
	Output:  
  	  current node's shortest path to all nodes  

# 2.Betweenness centrality for undirected graph  
	Input:  
  	  head-neighbor-cost  
  	  1 - 43 - 1378.56
  	  1 - 159 - 2549.13
  	  ...  
	Output:  
  	  node-betweenness-normalizedValue
  	  1-1296.000000-0.158979
  	  2-3478.000000-0.426644
  	  ...
