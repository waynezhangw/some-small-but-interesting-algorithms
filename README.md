For sharing the algorithm that I met during my academic and industrial career

# 1.Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for undirected graph  
	Input:  
  	  head id - tail id - edge cost  
  	  1 - 3 - 13  
  	  1 - 9 - 25  
  	  ...  
	Output:  
  	  current node's shortest path to all nodes  

To be continued...
